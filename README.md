# LINUX-Card-Game
The LINUX-Card-Game is almost like the game Bingo Card. There is a card with random but unique numbers on it called the LINUX card. The player inputs a random character and a random number is prompted in the call list. If the number matches the number and the designated column on the card, the particular number on the card gets marked. The first player to mark a full column or row or all the corners wins the game. I have received part help on this project from Harshita Singh and Abdul Amir.
